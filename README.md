# Master of Data Science Students Contribution
Master of Data Science students at the University of British Columbia have developed and deployed machine learning models aimed at enhancing data collection efficiency and preventing avoidable losses. Additionally, we provided insights into the survival probability of salmon in the Salish Sea by employing the Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) survival analysis model with a Bayesian approach.

All the deliverables, including codes and documentations, are stored under [MDS Deliverables](https://github.com/brahmwg/Bottlenecks_MDS_Capstone/tree/main/mds_deliverables) folder.
