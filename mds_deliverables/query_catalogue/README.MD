# SQL Queries 

The file containing six queries is a distinct component of the project. The data retrieved from these queries is not used in the current modeling; rather, it is provided to the biologists at the Pacific Salmon Foundation for their independent use.

The `queries.md` file includes a brief description of each query along with the corresponding SQL query.

Queries that successfully run are saved as separate queries and can be found by navigating to the corresponding link.
