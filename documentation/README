In this section we have various documentation to provide background on the Bottlenecks project.


The 'pg_dwh' image depicts an overview of the structure of our database system.
Raw files are loaded into a schema called 'staging'. This acts as our loading zone / staging area. There you will find all of the raw files collected by the project, and some other files deemed relevant for inclusion. Most of the files are ingested with datatypes set to VARCHAR or TEXT, before they are processed and assigned proper datatypes and moved to the next layer.
