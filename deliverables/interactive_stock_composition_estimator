An interactive stock composition estimator:

In that meeting with Wilf, Kevin requested that my stock comp models be interactive. E.g. in area 17F, draw a line splitting the subarea into two subpolygons, then estimate stock proportions with standard errors with mvtweedie.

Initially thought it was a daunting task, but I actually think it is quite straightforward. It doesn't require the model output, at least in its most practical application.

You can plot the individual fish locations with plotly (a Javascript plotting package that has a R package)... then lasso the points you want (or use the gatepoint package  to draw a "gate" through the subarea. Save the selected point as a dataframe, then subset with !%in% to get the remaining points. Assign a group variable. Run mvtweedie code.

It would need to be a shiny app. There are different packages that get you partway.
