## Data Modelling 

A possible task for the data science team would be to design/implement this normalized schema for our database. This would be useful for enforcing referential integrity, ensuring the reliability and accurary of the data.

Another possible task, would also be to implement a dimensional model, similar to the star schema which PTAGIS uses. The model PTAGIS uses is proprietary and not publicly shared, but you can investigate their model here:

A dimensional model would be useful for the broad analytical tasks we aim to produce. Furthermore, this could help position ourselves as a Salish Sea equivalent of PTAGIS for regional groups doing similar PIT tag work.
