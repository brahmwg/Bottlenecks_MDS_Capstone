## Species Prediction Model – Master of Data Science (UBC)

Objective: Utilize tagging location specific data from Bottlenecks Program, plus other data if available, to develop a predictive model that can help Bottleneck Biologists inform missing species data within the program. The primary output would be a suggested species with a probability. Bottlenecks staff with MDS will develop a framework for how to integrate these predictive data into the Bottlenecks Program and develop a “cut-off” for probability. Example: For genetic stock assignment, which utilizes a Bayesian informed model, there is a 0.75 probability minimum value that needs to be met for inclusion in analysis.

Model Type: Best Model Wins

Data Required:

· Bottlenecks PIT tagging data

· Bottlenecks PIT detection data

· Bottlenecks site specific temperature data

o Each in-river tagging site (typically) has a temperature logger deployed during the spring outmigration and tagging work (April to July)

· Hydrometric data

o Most Bottlenecks systems have hydrometric stations

§ Where not available to closest location should be used

§ River temp, flows, rain, etc.

· Local Environmental data

o Data to be compiled from local weather stations

§ Air temp, rainfall, snowpack

· Other?

Notes: The primary objective (to start) is to develop a simpler model to allow for species prediction for in-river tagging events. However, if students and the model show promise, a more complicated model could be developed for all Bottlenecks data (RST, estuary and microtrolling) and be used to predict not just species, but stock as well.
