## Outmigration Timing Model – Master of Data Science (UBC)

Objective: Utilize in-river tagging location specific data from Bottlenecks Program, plus other data if available, to develop a predictive model that can help Bottleneck Biologists inform our spring outmigration monitoring work. The predictive model should be able to provide information to the team on when to expect the spring outmigration to occur at each system for each species on given year. This model is for freshwater outmigration timing.

Model Type: Best Model Wins

Data Required:

· Bottlenecks PIT tagging data

· Bottlenecks PIT detection data

· Bottlenecks site specific temperature data

o Each in-river tagging site (typically) has a temperature logger deployed during the spring outmigration and tagging work (April to July)

· Hydrometric data

o Most Bottlenecks systems have hydrometric stations

§ Where not available to closest location should be used

§ River temp, flows, rain, etc

· Local Environmental data

o Data to be compiled from local weather stations

§ Air temp, rainfall, snowpack

· Other?

Notes: This product should not be confused with a climate model, or a large predictive model for all systems on the East Coast of Vancouver Island or B.C. The focus of this model should be to the site and species level, fine scale.

The output may help inform Bottlenecks Managers when to expect the spring outmigration to begin at each of our sampling locations and for each species.

Typically, Coho outmigrate first, and their outmigration timing is typically not as variable as Chinook. Chinook outmigration timing typically changes by days and weeks between years. In extreme years these changes can be over a month difference
