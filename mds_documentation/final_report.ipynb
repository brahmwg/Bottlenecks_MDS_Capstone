    "Our collaboration with the Pacific Salmon Foundation on the Bottleneck project will yield comprehensive visual analysis tools and advanced statistical and machine learning models, directly enhancing biologists' ability to understand salmon survival trends. By leveraging techniques from the Master of Data Science program, we aim to gain deepeer understanding of salmon survival probability, considering factors like predation, body size, origin site, and others."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Salmons are critical to the ecosystem as they are food to 137 species (Rahr, 2023), such as grizzly bears. In British Columbia, there are over 9,000 distinct salmon populations (\"State of Salmon\", 2022). However, due to climate change and industrial development in the past 150 years, the population of Pacific salmon in BC has declined and their habitats have been facing unprecedented pressures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pacific Salmon Foundation is a non-profit organization committed to guiding the sustainable future of Pacific salmon and its habitat. The organization has a wide range of work such as community investments and salmon health. As a part of the organization’s effort towards marine sciences, the Bottlenecks to Survival Projects investigate the survival bottlenecks, which refers to when a population size is reduced for at least one (\"Understanding Evolution\"), for salmon and steelhead throughout the Salish Sea and southern BC regions."

    "### Survival Analysis\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "In ecological terms, a bottleneck refers to a specific event that results in a sharp decline in a population over a period of time (Pacific Salmon Foundation, 2021). Identifying these bottleneck points throughout the various stages of a salmon’s life cycle is crucial, as it provides valuable insights into potential interventions to improve survival rates. Our study aimed to observe the survival and detection probabilities across five stages of the salmon’s outmigration-return path, as well as the cumulative survival probability from the first stage to the last. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preprocessing\n",
    "The data was extracted using SQL queries, stage-wise from the Strait of Georgia data center. The 5 stages identified were facility (hatchery), downstream, estuary, field (or microtroll) and return. For each of these stages, we wanted data of all wild and hatchery origin fishes. SQL queries were used to extract the required data from the data center. The columns extracted were the unique tag_id of a fish, the date on which it was detected, the “stage” at which this data is derived from, the origin of the fish (hatchery/ wild), the fork length of the fish, action (tag/ detect), species of the detected fish.\n",
    "![sample_table](img/survival_analysis_fig1.png)\n",
    "After data from all 5 stages are extracted in this manner, the datasets then go into a preprocessing.R file to be combined together. At this stage, we make any nomenclature changes needed to mitigate the variations in data that may have happened during the collection process. Finally, we output a CSV file (survival_analysis.csv) containing the data of all detections from all 5 stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Science Method\n",
    "Our study implemented the Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model (Cormack, 1964; Jolly, 1965; Seber, 1965), which was originally designed for studying bird migration. However, due to the model's heavy reliance on recapture rates, we incorporated Bayesian modeling to address concerns arising from the lack of recapture events. By utilizing prior knowledge through Bayesian modeling, we aim to enhance the analytical power of our sparse recapture data. This approach allows us to obtain more precise and accurate parameter estimates, thereby improving the reliability of our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data is modeled using hierarchical modeling to estimate survival and detection probabilities across multiple stages of the fish's outmigration-return path. The model combines elements of the CJS model with Bayesian techniques to handle sparse recapture data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our prior distributions are as follows, where $j$ indicates probabilities between stages. $\\phi_j$ depicts the survival probability of salmon across different stages, and $p_j$ depicts the detection probability of salmon across different stages. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi_j \\sim \\text{Beta}(1,1)$$\n",
    "$$p_j \\sim \\text{Beta}(1,1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our likelihood distributions are as follows, where $i$ indicates individual salmon. $z_{i,j}$ returns a binary value of either $0$ or $1$ to depict survival status of the fish, and $y_{i,j}$ depicts the binary value of either $0$ or $1$ to depict tagging status of the fish.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_{i,j} \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\phi_j, z_{i,j-1})$$\n",
    "$$y_{i,j} \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p_j, z_{i,j-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, to capture the cumulative survival rates of salmon across all stages, we recursively compute the cumulative probability through each stage based on the survival probability of the past stage. Note that $k$ represents a stage before the current stage $j$.\n",
    "$$\\text{Survship}_j = \\prod_{k=1}^{i=1} \\phi_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion and Future Recommendations\n",
    "We are actively working towards incorporating origin as a covariate and observing its effect on the survival probability of salmon. "

    "### Outmigration Model\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "The goal of this model is to accurately predict the outmigration timing of salmon. This model will take in river information including flow, level, and temperature, then use these predictors to predict the outmigration timing of salmon. With this model, we hope to better inform the biologists at the Pacific Salmon Foundation on which day in the year that they should go out to the field to tag salmon. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preprocessing\n",
    "- Merge four data together (salmon tagging tate, river temperature, river flow, river level)\n",
    "- Convert the date column to the right format\n",
    "- Create the rolling mean of river flow, river temperature, and river level each on a 5, 10, and 15 day basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Science Method\n",
    "- We used a xgboost model to predict the salmons that will outmigrate on a given date; then do a Lasso regression to\n",
    "  The model will return a range of dates on a given year based on the lower and upper quartile user decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion and Future Recommendations\n",
    "- Before choosing to use the XGBoost model, we experienced SARIMAX, logistic regression, and linear regression- these models were not able to predict results as ideal as XGBoost during the time we worked on them.\n",
    "- Currently, we experimented with training with 2014 to 2021 data and test on 2022 and 2023 data. The model is able to predict the starting date for 2022 but not 2023. This model can benefit from training with more data when available. "

    "##### Data Science Method\n",
    "The model that we finally landed on was a Deep learning neural network on a tensorflow framework. The reason for finalizing this model was due to its validation accuracy (95%) and due to its ability to detect subtle nuances in the dataset.\n",
